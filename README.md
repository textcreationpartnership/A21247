1. A TREATISE OF TREASONS against Q. Elizabeth and the Crowne of England: partly answering certaine Treasons pretended, that neuer were intended: and partly discouering greater Treasons committed, that are by few perceiued.

    _ 1. GOod men and euil delight in contraries. The good in seking for truth, and maintenance thereof: euil, in hiding of truth and oppressing thereof. And so consequently to publissh truth, is to please the good, and to displease the euill.

    _ 2. Wherefore, hearing, that emongest the common sortes of men at this time it is not certainely knowen, what is the cause, that the Duke of Northfolke is newly committed to the Tower, and sundry others: and knowing that good men •il be wel satisfied to vnderstand the truth, which euil men would couer and oppresse: I could not but in conscience, to satisfie the good, and bridle or stoppe the lying and open slaunderous mouthes of the euill and seditious, notifie thus muche vnto yow, whereby you may also cōmunicate the same to others: for that it is likely, that false and slaunderous reportes wil be readily made hereof, to serue the appetites of the euil disposed.

    _ Against the D. of Norf.3. First, it is not vnknowen, the Duke of Northfolke did of late yeares secretely practise to haue maried with the Scotish Q. without the knowlege of the Q. &c.

    _ Against the Q. of Scot.4. It is also knowen (saith he) that the Q. of Scotland hath bene the moste daungerous enemy that liued, against your Q. in that she sought to haue the Croune of England (as he saith) from her immediately after Queene Maries death. &c.

    _ 5. It is also knowē(saith he) that when she could not get it by force nor cunning, shee solemnely promised to acknowlegde her errour, and to recognise the Right of your Queene, &c.

    _ 6. It is knowen (saieth he) that she solempnely promised to acknowledge her error,A nedeless• and folish obiection. and to recognise the verie trewe right to be iustly in your Q &c. as laufull daughter and heire to kinge Henrie the eight. &c.

    _ 7. It is also knowen (saieth he) that she hath not perfourmed her promise, but with friuolous answers hath delaied it. Neither is it of any force to be demanded, nor woorth the hauing, if she would yeelde to performe it. For that, she that could not neither gette this realme &c. nor keepe her owne, &c. can not amende your Q estate, &c. nor yet is her promise in any thing to be holden fyrme or durable. &c.

    _ 8. It is said (saith he) and credibly auowed. that the Q. of Scotl. was the greatest cause of the rebellion lately in the North: wherby some honorable houses &c. by her cunning practise were inticed to ouerthrowe them selues and their families with a multitude of mo English subiects, then she could haue done by armes in the field, if she had bene in possession of her kingdome.

    _ 9. And it is knowen (saith he) that your Q. as one voide of a reuenging nature, did labour to haue restored her to her Coūtrey, and saued her life after the death of her Husband, and laboured to put an ende to the Ciuil warres in her Realme, &c.

    _ 10 It is also knowen (sayeth he) that the Q. of Scotl. did by writing vtterly renounce the Dukes mariage vpon his first apprehension, &c. with some note, that of her sel•e she did not first moue it, nor yet like of it. Also that the Duke did the like at that time both by messages and writings, and acknowleged his offense in seeking it: and vnder his hande and seale did firmely promise, neuer to deale therein an• further, or in any other matter with the Q. &c.

    _ 11. And now it is certeinly found (saieth he) that the former practise betwene the Q. and Duke (notwithstanding their •euerall renuntiations and promises) hath had continuance without interruption, &c. till now his last committing, &c.

    _ 12. But now appeareth it (saith he) how daungerous the intention of that mariage is to your Q. by other daungerous practises that haue accompained and followed this attempt (if you wil beleue him) which almighty God hath merueilously discouered, to the preseruation, both of your Q. person, and the Realme. &c.

    _ 13. It was deuised and determined (sayth he) that a new Rebellion should haue bene moued nigh London. The Citie should haue bene taken by force, foraine Souldiours in great numbers should haue come out of the Lowe Countreis by Sea vnto a notable Port of the Realme. So should Rebelles and foraine enemies haue ioyned and proceded to further things not expedient yet to be spoken of. &c.

    _ 14. These deuises saith he) were not onely talked of, put in writing, and fully concluded: but the Messengers were also sent ouer Sea in Lent last with sufficient authoritie of commission and writings, to testifie the determination of them, that should be the Heads and Conductours of this Rebellion, as the same beeing imparted on the other side the Sea was well accepted and allowed: and thereof seuerall Letters were speedily written to the saied Queene, to the Duke of Northfolke, and specially, to that vngracious Priest the Bisshoppe of Rosse, the instrument of all the Dukes calamitie, and the feed man of al treason against England: that this enterprise must be kept secret• namely from the Frenche, for causes of great moment, vntill the Messenger should poste to the Pope for money, and to the King of Spaine for order and direction for menne and shippes. & caet.

    _ •5. The Messenger had his letters of credit from the Scottish Queene, th• Duke and others to the Pope, and the king of Spaine. And so comming to Rome he returned letters from th• Popes gratious Holinesse in the beginning of Maie, to the sayd Q• and to th• Duke, and others. The letter to th• Duke was in Latine beginning: Dilecte fili, Salutem. But in deede the Duke might well say, he sent not Salutem, but perniciem. The Duke had them, and redde them, by the intercession of that aforesaied vngracious Priest. The con•entes in some parte were, that the Pope well allowed of the enterprise: he would write also to the King of Spayne to further it, but his present busines of the charitable warres than in preparing against the Turke was the cause, that money could not then be had for that sommer: and yet his vngratious Holynes after his accustomed sorte comforted them all not to despaire.

    _ 16. It was also by the deuisers of these Rebellions and inuasions determined,Ireland. that the Realme of Ireland should be assailed at the same time, thereby to weaken the Queenes Maiesties forces, or to diuert them from defense of her selfe and her good subiects.

    _ 17 Now were it best to leaue with these former branches: for it is credibly said, that this tree of treason and rebellion hath a number of other branches of the very like nature: that is, in deuising how the Scottish Queene should haue ben conueyed away, sometime by disguising, sometime by plaine force and raising of rebellion, and so put to libertie and proclaimed Queene of England •nd Scotland: but to encrease the errour of her stile, shee should haue ben proclaimed King and Queene of England and Scotland.

    _ 18. It might be also reported, how her Sonne should haue ben stolen out of Scotland,The Prince of Scotl. to be sent into Spaine, with suche like deuises tending to mooue troubles in the Realme, that was, and yet is (thanked be God) quiet.

    _ 19. And now it may be, that some will say, that many of these thinges are doubtfull, and percase wrested in reporte, either by malice, or by ouermuch credulitie. But truely in such credible sorte are all the thinges aboue mentioned with sundry others to me reported to be verie true, by such as haue cause to knowe them, and vse not to report vntruthes, as I do boldly auow them to be true.

    _ 20. And if they shalbe found otherwise, than it is likely, that somme of the Q. Maiesties Counsel wil cause them to be reprehended: who vpon this my writing shall reporte them, and thervpon I will patiently suffer correction for my hasty credit. For it is most likely, that such matters of Estate as these are, will not be suffered to be communicated without reprehension.

    _ 21. On the other side, if they be true, as I haue reported, and yet not fully ynough reported than time wil shortly enlarge and confirme them, when her Maiestie shall cause the parties now imprisoned to answer openly thereto, by order of her lawes, as there is no doubt she wil obserue to all maner of subiects that course, that hitherto she hath done• &c.

    _ Synce I wrote this, I am the more emboldened to thinke al these things true, for that this present day the Lord Maior of the Citie of London with a number of his Brethren were at the Starchāber with the Q. Maiesties Councel: where I vnderstood by the reporte of some of them, that heard what was said by the Councel to them concerning the present

case of the Duke of Norf. that the substance of al, that is by me before reported, is very true, with muche more, &c.
